# Dao Canvas

> All things DAO canvas!

<br>

## Motivation

Summoning a DAO is a lot like starting a business or creating a legal entity. This is because many of the questions are universal to human coordination in general. This repo aims to aggregate resources that help with that process!

## The Original DAO Canvas

Felipe Duarte created the original [DAOstack DAO Canvas](https://daocanvas.webflow.io/). It's great. We highly recommend checking it out!

## Simple DAO Canvas

As the DAO space evolved it became neccessary to have a DAO canvas that helps people think through the DAO design process before jumping into any specific tooling or framework. Thus, the [Simple DAO Canvas](https://hackmd.io/Bma08zqPQ4WA71rPm1DazA) was born! Just copypasta the doc and fill out the sections.
